### Hello!
I'm a student that loves learning and programming. I love sharing my discoveries with others, and making it easier
for the next person to do the same.

### [[AquariWM](https://github.com/AquariWM)]

  window managers, used in AquariWM.

### [[X Libraries for Rust](https://github.com/XdotRS)]

  X11 protocol.
- [X Rust Bindings](https://github.com/XdotRS/xrb): a direct implementation of the X11 specificaiton, used as the
  foundation for X.RS.
