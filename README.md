### Hello!
I'm just a student who loves learning and programming. I love sharing my discoveries with others, and I always try to
better the path I have travelled, to always make it easier for the next person! The most meaningful thing for me is
helping other people; someday I hope to develop something that has a bigger, more meaningful impact on people's lives.

### [AquariWM](https://github.com/AquariWM)
- [AquariWM Server](https://github.com/AquariWM/aquariwm): a modular window manager for X11.
- [Window Manager MetaClients Spec (WMMC)](https://github.com/AquariWM/wmmc-spec): a custom X protocol for modular
  window managers, used in AquariWM.
- [X.RS](https://github.com/AquariWM/x11-libraries/tree/main/xrs): a Rust API library for simplifying and optimizing
  communication with the X11 protocol.
- [X Rust Bindings](https://github.com/x11-libraries/tree/main/xrb): a direct implementation of the X11 specification,
  used as the foundation for XRS.

#### Development of AquariWM
At the moment, I am working on [AquariWM](https://github.com/AquariWM/aquariwm) - a window manager for X11, and
accompanying [specifications](https://github.com/AquariWM/wmmc-spec) and
[libraries](https://github.com/AquariWM/x11-libraries) to aid in that development. I intend for it to be a thoroughly
documented project that people can easily learn from and for it to make it much easier for people to get into using,
configuring, customizing, and contributing to window managers.

If that sounds like something that interests you, why not check it out? I would love to collaborate with more people
for its development, and I have made an effort to make it much easier to understand and get started developing than it
was for me. It is written in Rust, and uses a custom X library,
[X.RS](https://github.com/AquariWM/x11-libraries/tree/main/xrs/), that should handle the complexity typically associated
with window managers.
