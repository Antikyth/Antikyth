### Hello!
I'm very interested in concepts of Computer Science, learning about various areas of CS in depth, and creating projects to explore these. In Rust (I love Rust). Here are some of my current projects:

### [[X Libraries for Rust](https://github.com/XdotRS)]
- [X Rust Bindings](https://github.com/XdotRS/xrb): a direct implementation of the X11 specificaiton, used as the
  foundation for X.RS.

  **This is the only of these four projects in active development at the moment; the rest depend on XRB.**
- [X.RS](https://github.com/XdotRS/xrs): a Rust API library for simplifying and optimizing communication with the
  X11 protocol.

### [[AquariWM](https://github.com/AquariWM)]
- [AquariWM Server](https://github.com/AquariWM/aquariwm): a modular window manager for X11.
- [Window Manager MetaClients Spec (WMMC)](https://github.com/AquariWM/wmmc-spec): a custom X protocol for modular
  window managers, used in AquariWM.

#### Any and all contributions and/or feedback for any of the above projects is very much welcome!
