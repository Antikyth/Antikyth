### Hello!
I'm just a student who loves learning and programming. I love sharing my discoveries with others, and making it easier for the next person to do make those same discoveries.

### [[AquariWM](https://github.com/AquariWM)]
- [AquariWM Server](https://github.com/AquariWM/aquariwm): a modular window manager for X11.
- [Window Manager MetaClients Spec (WMMC)](https://github.com/AquariWM/wmmc-spec): a custom X protocol for modular
  window managers, used in AquariWM.
- [X.RS](https://github.com/AquariWM/x11-libraries/tree/main/xrs): a Rust API library for simplifying and optimizing
  communication with the X11 protocol.
- [X Rust Bindings](https://github.com/x11-libraries/tree/main/xrb): a direct implementation of the X11 specification,
  used as the foundation for XRS.

#### Any and all contributions welcome! AquariWM was created to be a community-focused project :)
